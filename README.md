CS-255 System Analysis & Design
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
-The driver pass project is meant to help new drivers get licensed by providing on the road training and study material. They wanted a highly available syste
What did you do particularly well?
-In the DriverPass project I feel I did a great job gathering requirements, and using them to make a functional design.  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-I would chose to revise the use case I depicted in the system Design document. I feel that I could been more descriptive in the actor descriptions and task functionality.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Implementing the users needs was the reasonfor the project being brought to my company. A new system needed to implemented to address the gap in driver education and training.
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software in a modular approach. I break down the large systems into smaller parts and design modules that perform the functions I desire.
